Another thing to try would be varying the "3" and the "4" above and find 
out what happens.  For example, for length n = 10 and 2 squares of 
length n-4 and 4 of length n-2 I get

518,519,520,526,528,535,536,537,543,545,552,553,554,560,562,569,570,571,
 
577,579,586,587,588,594,596,603,604,605,611,613,620,621,622,628,630,637,638,639,645,647,654,655,656,662,664,671,672,673,679,681,688,
 
689,690,696,698,705,706,707,713,715,722,723,724,730,732,739,740,741,747,749,756,757,758,764,766,773,774,775,781,783,790,791,792,798,
 
800,807,808,809,815,817,824,825,826,832,834,841,842,843,849,851,858,859,860,866,868,875,876,877,883,885,892,893,894,900,902,909,910,
 
911,917,919,926,927,928,934,936,943,944,945,951,953,960,961,962,968,970,977,978,979,985,987,994,995,996,1002,1004,1011,1012,1013,1019,1021

as the list of exceptions (sorry for the formatting)


and for 3 of length n-4 and 3 of length n-2 I get

827,836,844,845,853,854,861,862,863,870,871,872,878,879,880,881,887,888,

940,941,942,943,944,946,947,948,949,950,951,952,953,955,956,957,958,959,960,961,962,963,964,965,966,967,968,969,970,971,972,973,974,
